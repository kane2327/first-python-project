# Python Learning Environment

## Overview
This project is designed as an interactive Python learning environment for beginners. It contains a comprehensive `main.py` file with examples, explanations, and practice exercises covering Python fundamentals.

## Purpose
- Help beginners learn Python programming through interactive examples
- Provide hands-on practice with core Python concepts
- Encourage experimentation and exploration

## Current State
The project contains:
- `main.py`: Interactive Python tutorial covering variables, data types, strings, lists, dictionaries, control flow, loops, functions, and list comprehensions
- Practice exercises with solution templates
- Commented sections for learners to experiment with code

## How to Use
1. Click the "Run" button to execute the code and see the output
2. Read through each section to understand the concepts
3. Uncomment the "TRY IT" sections to practice writing your own code
4. Complete the practice exercises at the bottom of the file
5. Modify and experiment with the code to learn by doing

## Topics Covered
1. Variables and Data Types
2. Basic Operations (arithmetic)
3. Strings and string manipulation
4. Lists (arrays)
5. Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
6. Control Flow (if/else statements)
7. Loops (for and while)
8. Functions
9. List Comprehensions

## Recent Changes
- **2025-10-18**: Initial setup with Python 3.11 and comprehensive learning examples

## User Preferences
- Learning Python as a beginner
- Interactive, hands-on approach preferred

## Project Architecture
- Simple single-file structure for ease of learning
- Organized into clearly marked sections
- Progressive complexity from basic to more advanced concepts
- Includes practice exercises for reinforcement
